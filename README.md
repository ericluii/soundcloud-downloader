##Soundcloud Song Downloader

This script was written to be used on __MAC OS X__. Feel free to modify the script to work for your use case.

In order to use the script, first run the file install.sh

The second thing you must do is find an API key and place it in the download.py folder. The spot it should be placed can be find by searching for the text __YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__

After the dependencies have been installed, and you have your API key, you may then run this script.

    python download.py

In for the songs to be added to iTunes automatically, you might need to re-open iTunes for the changes to be seen.

Other than that, have fun (;
