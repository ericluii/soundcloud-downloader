This folder contains the cache files for downloading the likes of each user.

The purpose of these cache files is to ensure that no song is downloaded twice.

Generally, you should not need to touch these files, however the script may be skipping a song that you believe has not been downloaded before. If this occurs, you can find the id number that the script outputs and simply delete that number from the given cache file.
